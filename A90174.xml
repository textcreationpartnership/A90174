            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>And when Saint <hi>Briget</hi> had written the Legend from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells mouth in her owne tongue, then the Angell bad her to take it to Saint <hi>PETER</hi> for to draw it into Latine, and said thus unto her, say, he said, to his master that he and I are both one member in God, for he is as it were the outward member and I am the inward member.</p>

               </gap>ken, after they were drawne into Latine, to him the lessons &amp; revelations were brought, to see that they were set in true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ent termes, without errour or darknesse, for hee was a great Clarke.</p>
            <p>From hence they conclude that the Service booke ought to be used, in sing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng, reading, and praying, with more diligence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion then other rayers, not onely for the holy ordinance, and the setting thereof, but because they are more bound thereto (say they) in divers wise. One for the ordinance and obedience of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church, where all that are bound to divine Service are bidden strictly in vertue of holy obedience, to say or sing the said service,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112373:4"/> not altering a word from it, for that is forbidden (say they) by holy Church, under great pain, and the Prelates of the Church bee charged to take heede thereof. An other thing is in respect of your foundations.</p>
            <p>The third bond is from the rule of your profession (say they) whereby ye are solemnly bound to the observance of this set forme more then any Prophets; for it pleaseth God more (say they) as is more profitable to us. And then they relate a story of the soule of one whom they call an holy religious man, which appeared to his Abbot after his death, and bad him to exhort his brethren to say this holy divine service with all reverence and devotion, that the Angells might offer it up to God, while they so duly observe it, for this holy Service (he said) in earth pleaseth God, as much as that which is done of Angells before his high Majesty in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is also (say they) better to observe this forme, and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with God, then ten thousand other Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make the people beleeve that it is very perilous to them to be absent from the Church during the time of Divine Service; they tell them an abominable lie, which is placed in their Service book; which is as followeth.</p>
            <p>THere was (say they) a great and worthy Clarke that left the World and became a religious man in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and kept the rigour of his Religion in great straightnesse all the dayes of his life who was absent from the Quire at a certaine time (yet by the licence of his Abbot) But after he was dead and buried, one night as the Abbot stood at mattins with his brethren, he see one to stand in the same place where this man used to sit when he was at Mattins
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112373:4"/> himselfe; who lowly enclined to the Abbot, understanding that it was the same mans soule, he went with him out of the quire into the Chapitre house, where the Soule was immediately taken, and so tormented for a long time, and after his torment he appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to this Abbot, and then the Abbot asked him the cause of his paine, he answered and said, for Divine Service, because I was absent from it.
